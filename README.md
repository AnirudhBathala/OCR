# OCR
Optical Character Recognition using python - https://github.com/SaiTarunUppari/OCR.wiki.git
This is simple project that recognizes and reads text in images.
The image is to be captured using webcam with a resolution of at least 2 mega-pixel.
The image should be perpendicular to the camera while capturing the frame.
The code does not work for images containing perspective distortions.
Any 2-dimensional skew will be corrected.
